orgklip --- Kindle clippings to org-mode

Juan Reyero, http://juanreyero.com

I am not maintaining this package.  Please take a look at

https://github.com/juanre/org-bib

for what I am using now.


This Python module builds an org-mode version of a book's clippings as found in a kindle clippings files.

Please note that this is alpha code.  I am still changing it almost as fast as I use it.

It looks for clippings in

'/Volumes/Kindle/documents/My Clippings.txt'

or in

'kindle-clippings.txt'.

If the former exists it is copied onto the later as a backup.

It produces a unique id that makes also a reasonable bibtex id for the book, and that looks like:

adams-2009---dirk-gently-s-holistic-detective-agency

By default it will create a new .org file with an entry for the book, named with the book id:

adams-2009---dirk-gently-s-holistic-detective-agency.org

But if the print_clippings function is called with an existing output file it will append to it.

The entry for the book includes all the available metadata and a link to the book file.  A text version of the book is created, and each clipping includes an org-mode link to the point of the text file where the clipping appears.  This makes it slow.

If the org-mode file to which the clippings will be aded exists, and a clipping is already present, it will not be added again.
